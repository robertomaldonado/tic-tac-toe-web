# Web dev Projects

Some of he project that I have developed while testing different technologies.

## Link to website

Visit the game at Netlify: https://clever-tic-tac-toe.netlify.app

## Project within this repo:

- Tic-Tac-Toe:
  It has been developed with HTML, CSS and Js plus the aid of github's Copilot, embedded in VSCode, as a way to test how AI behaves as an assistnat while coding with web languages.
  I also used netlify to upload the app and have it visible so people can play if they reach the site.

  Findings include that Copilot is aware of styles and color palette being used in CSS classes, it is also efective to work with selectors and adding the event listeners, it also evaluates when writting counter part methods such as closing, opening, changing styles via classes.
  Once Copilot has interacted enough it was able to predict code that was to be placed inside of a functions, so it seems it can grab more awareness although it wont develop difficult logic but it will serve as a template in case you forget how to use language specific things such as map, reduce, every for Javascript.

## Sugestions

This project uses live server to view the static/dynamic file, install it on vscode to try it.

This project is created to test out github's copilot, install it on vscode to try it.

We use netlify drop in order to load the app and have it up and running.
