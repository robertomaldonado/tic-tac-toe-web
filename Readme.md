# Web dev Projects

Some of he project that I have developed while testing different technologies.

## Project within this repo:

- Tic-Tac-Toe:
  It has been developed with HTML, CSS and Js plus the aid of github's Copilot, embedded in VSCode, as a way to test how AI behaves as an assistnat while coding with web languages.
  Findings include that it is aware of styles and color palette being used in CSS classes, it is also efective to work with selectors and adding the event listeners, it also evaluates when writting counter part methods such as closing, opening, changing styles via classes.
